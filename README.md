# Learning Caravaggio
A good looking Neural Style Transfer project

## Why not?
I have been always passionate of art. Some time ago, while studying for the class of Deep Learning, at the third of fourth lession (do not remember, actually) the teacher told me about the possibility of "smashing" the style of a painter on a picture. With no previous experience, maybe getting too much into it, luckily, I found a lot of material to study.

I tried some code until I read [Neural Style Transfer: Creating Art with Deep Learning using tf.keras and eager execution](https://medium.com/tensorflow/neural-style-transfer-creating-art-with-deep-learning-using-tf-keras-and-eager-execution-7d541ac31398). I played a lot with this code manipulating it for a while and I learned a lot about this unknown topic (maybe too much advanced for a beginner) and I came up with some good looking results.

I am not going to publish the code, however you can easily find a good starting point at the link above.
