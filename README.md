# Learning Caravaggio
A good looking Neural Style Transfer project.

## Why not?
I have been always passionate of art. Some time ago, while studying for the Deep Learning class the teacher told us about the possibility of applying the style of a painter to a picture.

I tried some code until I read the article [Neural Style Transfer: Creating Art with Deep Learning using tf.keras and eager execution](https://medium.com/tensorflow/neural-style-transfer-creating-art-with-deep-learning-using-tf-keras-and-eager-execution-7d541ac31398). I played a lot with the code shown there, manipulating it for a while and learning a lot about this unknown topic. In the end I was able to obtain some good looking results.

I am not going to publish the code, however you can easily find a good starting point at the link above.
